This is an application for Food delivery service, which will help you to buy products in food online stores. You can choose the products you need and put them in the shopping cart. Once the Product has been placed in the cart, the 'buy button' will change to the 'remove button'. You can change the quantity of the products on the cart page. Also, you can remove products from the cart.

Products in the shopping cart are stored in the local storage, so you can refresh your page without loosing products.

At the Orders page you can find your prewious orders.
